# Description

This is a [Web Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) to showcase my development work. Comprised of coding and web dev projects to highlight my talents to prospective employers. It was designed using React as a single page web application.

## Project Objectives
Design a polished and professional portfolio using React.js while relying on advanced CSS to accomplish site design and styling. I will also utilize media queries, flex-box and scaling elements to maintain a consistent look on all screen sizes. Support for Dark Mode will also be included with some alternate styling choices for the dim eyed among us.

I will also include many CSS animations and transitions to breathe some life and excitement into an otherwise perfectly fine looking website.
